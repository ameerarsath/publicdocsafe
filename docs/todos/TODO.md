## Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Order for Development
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Complete missing frontend UI for Features 1-2 (Authentication & MFA)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement Feature 3 (RBAC) backend and frontend
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Implement Feature 4 (Document Management)
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Implement Feature 5 (Admin Dashboard)
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Implement Features 6-8 (Security, Search, Optimization)

### Development Approach
- **TDD First**: Always write comprehensive tests before implementation
- **Feature Complete**: Each feature must include both backend AND frontend
- **Security First**: All features must meet security standards before completion
- **Mobile Responsive**: All UI components must work on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI components

### Definition of Feature Complete
Each feature is considered complete when:
1. ✅ All backend APIs implemented and tested
2. ✅ All frontend UI components implemented and tested
3. ✅ End-to-end integration tests pass
4. ✅ Security testing completed
5. ✅ Documentation updated
6. ✅ Mobile responsiveness verified
7. ✅ Accessibility standards met

### Next Recommended Task
**Start with Feature 1.2 (Authentication Frontend UI)** as it's required for all other features and will provide the foundation for user interaction with the application.
