# Zero-Knowledge Security Architecture Implementation

  ## Overview
  This document outlines the implementation tasks for converting AI DocSafe from a traditional server-side authentication model to a Zero-Knowledge Architecture where the server never has access to user
  encryption keys or document content.

  ## Core Principles
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Login authentication vs. document encryption
  - **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption/decryption happens in the browser
  - **Zero Server Knowledge**: Server never sees encryption passwords or master keys
  - **Forward Security**: Compromise of server doesn't compromise document content

  ## Implementation Status Summary

  ### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Significant Progress)
  - **Database Models**: Comprehensive encryption models (`UserEncryptionKey`, `MasterKey`, `KeyEscrow`, `EncryptionAuditLog`)
  - **Backend Encryption API**: Full encryption endpoints (`/api/v1/encryption/*`) with key management, derivation, validation
  - **Frontend Crypto Infrastructure**: Complete Web Crypto API implementation with AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2
  - **Document Encryption Support**: Client-side encryption/decryption capabilities for documents
  - **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration and cleanup
  - **Admin Recovery System**: Key escrow infrastructure with audit logging

  ### üöß IN PROGRESS (Partially Implemented)
  - **Document Model**: Has encryption fields but missing specific `encrypted_dek` column for per-document keys
  - **Authentication Flow**: Traditional auth works, but zero-knowledge registration/login workflow needs UI integration

  ### ‚ùå NOT STARTED
  - **User Model**: Missing zero-knowledge specific fields (`encryption_salt`, `key_verification_payload`)
  - **Registration/Login UI**: Two-stage authentication components not implemented
  - **Document-Specific Keys**: DEK-per-document architecture vs. current session-based approach

  **Overall Assessment**: ~70% implementation complete. Core cryptographic infrastructure is solid and production-ready.
